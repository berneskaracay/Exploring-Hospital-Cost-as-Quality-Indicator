### Overview
US healthcare is so expensive this app helps people to find cheapest and best hospital in their region.

### Motivation

As a immigrant I have had any major experience with USA healtchare system but I always hear that it is very expensive. My first experience was 4 months ago when my wife had c-section. I recieved the bill one month latter and it is a lot. Hence, I decide to make this Shiny App in order to help people to find cheapest and highest quality hospital in their state. 

### Null and Alternative Hypotheses

**Null Hypothesis**:
Is healthcare cost good indicator for quality of healthcare? 
My initial hypothesis is: Yes because the hospital charges more if they
hire better doctors and good technologies which are both
expensive to attain.

### Data Collection and Preparation

The hospital quality data used here is from the [HCAHPS Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems](https://www.hcahpsonline.org/en/) for the year 2016. 

The hospital payment data used here is from the
[CMS Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-provider-charge-data/inpatient.html) for the year 2016. This data includes information on utilization, payment (total payment and Medicare payment), and hospital-specific charges for the more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments. 


### Preliminary Findings
Majority of the medical procedures there is a negative correlation between quality and cost.
